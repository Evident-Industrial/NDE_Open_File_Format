# Supporting Software

Software that reads or writes .nde files are listed on this page. Depending on the level of integration and specialization, some software will only be compatible with .nde files produced with a specific instrument or software (mainly in cases where the [Private](../hdf5-structure/private-group.md) section is used). However, data access and interoperability is still provided through the [Public](../hdf5-structure/public-group.md) section of the file. 

Feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:nde_support@evidentscientific.com) if you want your software to be added to this list.
