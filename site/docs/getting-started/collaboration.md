# Collaboration

## Collaborate with EVIDENT

[Evident](https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/) currently controls the specifications of the NDE open file format and its releases, while remaining open to collaboration to extend it to other modalities or add new features. Since the format is based on open-source technologies, anyone is free to reuse or modify it for their own purposes.

We encourage other **vendors**, **service providers**, **asset owners**, and **academics** to [reach out](mailto:nde_support@evidentscientific.com) if interested in partnering with us to improve and add new functionalities to the NDE open file format. 

Please note that as Evident invests significant resources and effort to provide comprehensive support and development, any new collaborator or contributor should be prepared to dedicate substantial time and effort to uphold the same standards of testing and documentation that we currently maintain.

## Contributing to an open format future 

[Evident](https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/) is also involved in other initiatives and working groups, such as those led by [EPRI](https://www.epri.com/) in the US and [COFREND](https://www.cofrend.com/) in France. Our objectives include sharing insights and experiences from the open file format development process, as well as exploring new functionalities and improvements. Unlike many initiatives that focus on export formats, we designed the .nde open file format with versatility in mind, allowing it to function as a native format for any instrument or software.

## Experimental features

<!-- md:flag experimental --> 

You may find features or properties tagged as throughout the documentation. These features are considered for future releases but are not yet officially integrated into the .NDE File Format. This allows us to share ongoing developments with you while awaiting final decisions and approval. We welcome [your feedback](mailto:nde_support@evidentscientific.com) on these features to help us refine their final versions.
